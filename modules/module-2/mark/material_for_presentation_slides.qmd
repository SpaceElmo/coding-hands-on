# Material to pull across to the presentation slides

## Lesson 1

This is based on MoqUps!

* What is process mapping

## Lesson 2

* What is a python virtual environment?
* What is OOP?

### Build a consent form

## Install reflex (if we have not already done this for the student)

* See [here](https://reflex.dev/docs/getting-started/installation/) for further details

```.bash
pip install reflex
```

## Change directory

```.bash
cd users/<your name>/module-2/
```

## Initialise the project

```.bash
reflex init
```

* Chose template 0

## Update port so you do not conflict with other people

/* TODO #1 We need to find a way to give everyone their own port

* add `frontend_port=<your port number>,` as line 5 below:

```{.python filename="rxconfig.py" code-line-numbers="true"}
import reflex as rx

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="module_2",
    frontend_port=3001,
)
```

## Run the app

```.bash
reflex run
```

* Press and hold on the CTRL/CMD key and click on http://localhost:<your port>, and this will open up your basic web app.
* You should see a browser that looks like this
<add picture of basic browser view>

## Start editing

* In the navigation window (the column on the left) open up `users/<your username>/modules/module-2/module-2/`.
* Open up the python file `module-2.py`.

```{.python filename="module-2.py" code-line-numbers="true" code-line-numbers="2"}
def index() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.center(
        rx.theme_panel(),
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading("Welcome to Reflex!", size="9"),
            rx.text("Get started by editing ", rx.code(filename)),
            rx.button(
                "Check out our docs!",
                on_click=lambda: rx.redirect(docs_url),
                size="4",
            ),
            rx.logo(),
            align="center",
            spacing="7",
            font_size="2em",
        ),
        height="100vh",
    )
```
