# Material to pull across to the presentation slides

## Lesson 1

This is based on MoqUps!

* What is process mapping

## Lesson 2

* What is a python virtual environment?
* What is OOP?

### Build a consent form

## Install reflex (if we have not already done this for the student)

* See [here](https://reflex.dev/docs/getting-started/installation/) for further details

```.bash
pip install reflex
```

## Change directory

```.bash
cd users/<your name>/module-2/
```

## Initialise the project

```.bash
reflex init
```

* Chose template 0

## Update port so you do not conflict with other people

* We need to find a way to give everyone their own port.
* add `frontend_port=8000,` as line 5 below:

```{.python filename="rxconfig.py" code-line-numbers="true"}
import reflex as rx

config = rx.Config(
    app_name="module_2",
    frontend_port=8000,
)
```

## Run the app

```.bash
reflex run
```
